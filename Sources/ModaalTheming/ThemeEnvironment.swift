import SwiftUI
import UIKit

// The view layer's route to the theme: a view reads `@Environment(\.theme)`
// and calls `theme.color(.token)` / `theme.font(.token)`. No view takes a
// theming parameter, however deeply nested, and no view model carries one on
// behalf of its views.
//
// A SwiftUI environment value does not cross a UIKit boundary, so the theme is
// published once per SwiftUI tree — at the `UIHostingController` that roots it.
// Subclass `ThemedHostingController` and hand it the provider:
//
// ```swift
// final class SomeViewController: ThemedHostingController<SomeView> {
//   init(theme: ThemeProviding, viewState: SomeViewState) {
//     super.init(theme: theme, rootView: SomeView(viewState: viewState))
//   }
// }
// ```
//
// An app whose entire view tree hangs off ONE hosting controller publishes
// once instead, with `ThemeScope`:
//
// ```swift
// UIHostingController(rootView: ThemeScope(theme) { RootScreen() })
// ```
//
// Do not replace this with a custom UIKit trait bridged through
// `UITraitBridgedEnvironmentKey`. That bridge is compiled in only when the
// package DECLARING the conformance is built with an iOS 17 deployment target
// or higher — under a lower floor it compiles, the trait itself still stores
// and inherits, and every `@Environment(\.theme)` read silently returns the
// default below with no diagnostic at build or run time. Raising this package
// to iOS 17 also raises it for every package that depends on Theming, which
// SwiftPM enforces as a hard version-solve error.

  // The theme itself comes from the app's `ThemeDefaulting` conformance on
  // `ThemeDefaults` — this module names no concrete theme.

  // `ThemeProvidingUpdating` (the mutable half) never travels here.

/// `UIHostingController.rootView` is `public`, not `open`, so overriding its
/// setter here is rejected with `overriding non-open property outside of its
