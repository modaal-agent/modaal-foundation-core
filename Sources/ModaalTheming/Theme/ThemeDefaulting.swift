/// A conformance is a declaration linked into the binary, not a startup call:
/// there is no registration ordering, no global mutable state, and Xcode
/// previews and test hosts resolve it without running any app startup code.

/// `defaultAppearance()` has a `.system` default; implement it only to choose
/// something else.
public protocol ThemeDefaulting {
    /// The theme a SwiftUI tree renders with when no hosting root published a
    /// provider and nothing is persisted — Xcode previews and unhosted trees.
